# Car Insurance Claim Analysis Repository 🛡️

Welcome to the Car Insurance Claim Analysis repository under EduTECH! This repository provides insights into fraud detection patterns within car insurance claims, helping insurers enhance their vetting processes and reduce fraudulent activity.

🔍 Key Findings:

Frequent Address Changes 🏠: Claims involving address changes within the last 6 months to 2-3 years show a slightly increased fraud risk.

Vehicle Price Sensitivity 💵: Claims on high-value vehicles (over $69,000) or low-value ones (under $20,000) have a modest link to fraud.

Policy Type 🚙: Fraud tends to be more prevalent with "Sport" or "Utility" policies, especially with collision coverage.

📈 Recommendations:

Enhanced Vetting 🔍: Conduct rigorous checks on claims with recent address changes.

Focus on High/Low-Value Vehicles 🛠️: High and low-priced vehicle claims may require more in-depth verification.
